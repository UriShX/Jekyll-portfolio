  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Ever since I first picked up a guitar, I’ve been interested in the physics and mechanics of musical instruments. That interest led me to study musicology and art history for a while, than I moved on to study cabinetmaking, as I wanted more knowledge in how wooden things actually get built and made. After a few years working in a commercial cabinetmaking shop, my desire to build guitars took me to learn with Paul Doyle at <a href="http://pauldoyleinstruments.com/school_about.php">The Irish School of Lutherie</a>, where I built my first acoustic guitar.</p>

<p>I worked for a couple of years in a digital print shop in Jerusalem as the technical go-to guy, where between making sure the presses ran smoothly I did my best to find the best technical solutions for the many graphical designers and design students that were among the shop’s clientele.</p>

<p>During my time in the print shop, I figured that I craved more knowledge in how things work, and so I went on to study for a four-year plastic engineering Bachelor’s degree (BSc) in Shenkar college. During my senior year, I found a student position in one of Israel’s rubber manufacturing companies, and then went on to take a full-time engineering position in that company. In this position I was responsible for the design of new projects, and maintenance of existing projects, for the company’s infrastructure and defense costumers.</p>

<p>With my new skills and better understanding of physics, materials, and programming, I decided to open up my own firm, where I am looking for new ways to fill the gap between engineering, art, and sound.</p>

<p>Happily married to Aya, and the proud owner (or pet of) two cats.</p>
