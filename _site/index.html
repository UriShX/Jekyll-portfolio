<p>My name is Uri Shani, and I am a maker, a tinkerer, and an engineer.</p>

<p>I can design and build most anything out of wood, program and build Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices, design all sorts of mechanical contraptions and devices, and design rubber and plastic parts for any manufacturing technology. In the past year or so I’ve taught myself to program web apps, at first in order to provide virtual UI to Arduino apps, then later it became a goal all in it’s own.</p>

<p>You can find out more about some of my past and current projects on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>. You can also read about some of my adventures in making over the last few years on my blog postings, below.</p>

            New Jekyll blog and portfolio
          </a>
        </h3><p>I’ve been using a WordPress personal site for some time, but I decided it was time for change. Mainly, I thought it would be good for me to take the time and rebuild the portfolio portion of the site in order to have more control and a better understanding of how it was built, and to allow me to expand it’s usefullness to me. <br />
My two main gripes with the WP portfolio were that a) I could not easily display both visual content (i.e. images) as well as markdown and code snippets, and b) the portfolio was displayed by a subscription based, payed plugin. Writing my own portfolio template helped me both overcome both of these problems, as well as taghut me quite a bit about my design skills and sharpened my understanding of Sass and CSS in general.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>I decided to separate this blog from my main website. The main reason being that I need to use the website as an online portfolio, and I did not think there’s a justification to mix in the blog and too much personal stuff in that. The other reason is that I feel more comfortable writing about technical stuff in English, and my portfolio and business pages need to be in both Hebrew and English. <br />
Hope it works well, though if it doesn’t I can still probably figure out how to revert the process.</p>

        </h3><p>This post is mostly a technical documentation of a project I have done a few years ago, and have never been documented before. The reason for doing a write-up now is so I can have a step back and see where I am today, compared to a few years ago. Also, it might be interesting to others. I hope my wife, which designed the lampshade, will someday do a write-up concerning her design decisions.</p>

        </h3><p>I kind of let the blog thing fade. I’m not a fan of documenting, I’m always thinking that what I think today might sound awful tomorrow, and that who the hell am I to actually come up with ideas, and similar debilitating thoughts. So I usually just don’t document. But… I set up this blog in the hope of actually writing down some of my thoughts, and I haven’t really used it yet, so… Here goes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I have this vision of building an easy to assemble and program DIY MIDI controller. This is supposed to be a modular system for musicians, DJ’s, sound technicians, etc., who don’t want to learn electronics or (even basic) programming.</li>

        </h3><p>When I was about 13 I became fascinated with the design of electric guitars. My mother who is a librarian took me with her to a warehouse of a company that imported magazines from around the world to Israel. She took me there to look at comics, but I found there fascinating magazines on all kinds of subjects. There were firearms magazines, sewing magazines, magazines for car and motorcycle enthusiasts, and many other topics. The best magazines I found (and my mother bought me) were the fringe and wacky comics and musical instruments magazines.</p>
