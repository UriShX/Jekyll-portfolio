This is a short portfolio of significant works I have done over the past few years. Clicking on the tiles will open a popup with more details about the work. Some of the tiles also have a link to code samples, 3D designs, or other relevant materials.

Please contact me for further details about any of the projects listed below. You can also find me on  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/uri.sh.982), Twitter ([@UriShX](https://twitter.com/UriShX)), and on [Hackcady.io](https://hackaday.io/UriSh).

The Github repo for this portfolio is: [github.com/UriShX/portfolio](https://github.com/UriShX/portfolio). A markdown portfolio that was the basis for starting this project lives [here](https://github.com/UriShX/portfolio).
