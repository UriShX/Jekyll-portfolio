# Staticman configuration
# See https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html for 
# step-by-step instructions
# 
# The URL for the staticman API bridge endpoint
# You will want to modify some of the values:
#  ${github-username}: the username of the account with which you publish your blog
#  ${blog-repo}: the name of your blog repository in github
#  master: this the branch out of which your blog is published, often master or gh-pages
#  ${bridge_app_name}: the name you chose in Heroku for your bridge API
#  comments: the so-called property, this defines the key in staticman.yml where the configuration is found
# 
# staticman_url: https://${bridge_app_name}.herokuapp.com/v2/entry/${github-username}/${blog-repo}/master/comments

# reCaptcha configuration info: the exact same site key and *encrypted* secret that you used in staticman.yml
# I personally don't think the secret needs to be included in the generated site, but the staticman API bridge uses
# it to ensure the site configuration and bridge configuration match (but why not just compare the site key?)
# 
# reCaptcha:
#   enabled: true
#   siteKey: siteKey from Google reCaptcha
#   secret: exactly the same secret as the staticman.yml file

plugins:
  - jekyll-highlight-param
  - jekyll-remote-include
