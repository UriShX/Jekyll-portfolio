# *Welcome!*
My name is Uri Shani, and I am a maker, a tinkerer, and an engineer.

I can design and build most anything out of wood, program and build Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices, design all sorts of mechanical contraptions and devices, and design rubber and plastic parts for any manufacturing technology. In the past year or so I've taught myself to program web apps, at first in order to provide virtual UI to Arduino apps, then later it became a goal all in it's own.

You can find out more about some of my past and current projects on my [portfolio]({{ "/portfolio" | relative_url }}). You can also read about some of my adventures in making over the last few years on my blog postings, below.
